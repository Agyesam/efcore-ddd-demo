# Domain driven design with Entity Framework Core

Welcome to this repository. In this repository you'll find demo code that shows 
how to use Entity Framework Core with Domain Driven Design. Please be aware, 
it's pretty opinionated. 

## System requirements

* Dotnet 5.0 SDK
* Visual Studio Code or a similar IDE/Editor

## Getting started

You can run this demo using a set of unit-tests that are included. Please follow
these steps to run the tests on your machine:

* `git clone https://github.com/wmeints/efcore-ddd-demo`
* `cd efcore-ddd-demo/src`
* `dotnet test`

No database is required, this code base uses the in-memory provider 
for this purpose.
